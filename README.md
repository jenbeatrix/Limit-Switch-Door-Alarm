# Door Alam using Limit Switch as Trigger
This is a device that I have made when I was a 3rd Year Electronics Engineering Student. Limit switch door alarm is a device that will inform the user if there is someone who trespasses inside your home. This alarm has a loud buzzer that will alert the owner or someone residing the property. 

Materials:
1. 12V Battery
2. Buzzer (Preferrably the larger one)
3. 12V Relay
4. C2655 Transistor
5. 1k Ohms Transistor
6. 2A Diode 
7. Normally Closed Switch
